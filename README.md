# **Apple Keyboard Function Key Fix for Windows**  
---
This script allows Apple keyboards with **F13-F19 keys** to properly use the function keys (F1–F12) as labeled on Windows. Normally, pressing the key just presses F1-F12, but with this fix, they will perform their functions as labbeled when the F19 key is held.  

### **Features**  
✔️ Enables function keys (F1–F12) when used with **F19**  
✔️ Supports all functions (except **Eject**)  
✔️ **Dashboard key** shows the desktop instead (since Windows lacks Dashboard)  
✔️ No need for this fix if using **Boot Camp**  

### **Brightness Control**  
For **brightness keys to work**, use [Twinkle Tray](https://twinkletray.com/):  
1. Set **Alt + Page Up** for brightness up  
2. Set **Alt + Page Down** for brightness down  
3. After setup, brightness control will function properly  

### **Notes**  
- If you experience issues, Ensure you followed all previous instructions.  
- If using Boot Camp, you **don’t need this fix**—Boot Camp already maps function keys correctly.
